# GDD Amendments to Decide

Places where the build has diverged from `Kailee_Nekoba_GDD_Final_Draft.pdf`, or where
the GDD disagrees with itself.

Each entry states what the GDD says, what was actually built, and why. **No
recommendations.** Which way each one resolves, amend the GDD or change the build, is
Kai's call.

## 1. Physics-simulated prize drops

**What the GDD says.** Section 2.1, core-loop step 1: hostiles burst "into a physical
shower of coins, cash bundles, and retro household appliances (toasters, TVs) **with
physics simulation**." Section 2.3 repeats the physical-loot description.

**What was built.** A scripted launch arc. Each drop is teleported along a parabola
about 33 times a second until it returns to the floor. No engine physics is involved at
any point.

**Why.** Engine physics is not reachable for spawned props. `SetDynamic(true)` and
`ApplyLinearImpulse` only do anything on a prop whose asset carries a physics body, and
a Content Browser search found no `creative_prop_asset` in the library that has one. The
only physics items available are `physics_boulder_device` and `physics_tree_device`,
which are placed devices (FortPlaysetItemDefinitions) and cannot be spawned from Verse.
Both calls return `void` and fail silently, so the drops simply never moved.

The visible result matches the GDD's intent, loot that bursts outward and lands. The
mechanism does not match its wording.

## 2. The melee Swarmer

**What the GDD says.** Section 5.4 commits to "2 cybernetic hostile models (**melee
Swarmer**, heavy Ranged Tank)." Section 2.4 puts "weak melee Cyber-Swarmers only" in
Room-Loop 1.

**What was built.** `CyberSwarmerMelee`, a Guard with 40/40 health, raised movement
speed and the lowest accuracy setting. It is armed, not melee. It pressures the player
by closing distance fast and shooting badly.

**Why.** Adding an Inventory Modifier to a Guard to remove its weapon makes it
completely passive: it will not chase and it will not attack. A genuinely weaponless
melee enemy is not achievable that way. The fast, inaccurate, armed version reads as
melee pressure in play without the passivity.

A true melee hostile would need a different approach entirely, not another attempt at
Inventory Modifiers.

## 3. The Playtest QA agent

**What the GDD says.** Section 4 defines the Playtest QA agent as one that "parses raw
output logs (**qa_log.txt**) and code diffs from manual playtests using a free,
**locally-hosted Llama-3 model** to isolate navigation-mesh errors and crash vectors."

**What was built.** `.claude/agents/playtest-qa.md`, a Claude Code subagent with
read-only tools. It reads the newest UEFN session log from
`C:\Users\kaile\AppData\Local\UnrealEditorFortnite\Saved\Logs` and reports failures,
broken invariants and anomalies. It does not parse code diffs.

**Why.** Three parts of the GDD's description do not match the build: the model is
Claude rather than a locally-hosted Llama-3, the source is the UEFN session log rather
than a `qa_log.txt`, and code-diff parsing is not implemented. The agent's purpose,
isolating faults from manual playtests without touching the code, is unchanged, and
GDD 4.1's rule that the agent reports only to the human designer is enforced by giving
it no tools that can modify anything.

## 4. The enemy roster contradicts itself

**This one is internal to the GDD.** It is not a build divergence.

**What Section 3.3 says.** The weapon table names three hostile types in its tactical
effects: "Cyber-Swarmers" (Submachine Gun row), "armored **Cyber-Boars**" (Shotgun row),
and "distant, stationary **Ranged Sentinels**" (Sponsor Sniper row).

**What Section 5.4 says.** The MVP asset ceiling funds "2 cybernetic hostile models
(melee Swarmer, **heavy Ranged Tank**)."

**The conflict.** Cyber-Boars have no model budgeted anywhere in the document. The
ranged enemy is called "Ranged Sentinels" in 3.3 and "heavy Ranged Tank" in 5.4, which
may be two names for one enemy or two different enemies. Three weapon effects in 3.3,
the Shotgun's chain knockback in particular, are written against enemies the MVP does
not fund.

Nothing has been built either way. The Shotgun and Sniper are not implemented yet, so
this is undecided rather than diverged.

## 5. The orthographic camera

**What the GDD says.** Section 1.1, Look and Feel: the visual perspective is "a locked
top-down camera with a bird's-eye **orthographic** perspective (objects maintain constant
scale regardless of position, removing lens distortion)." The camera "is anchored at a
fixed height above the flat stadium floor, providing a complete view of incoming
threats."

**What was built.** A Fixed Angle Camera device set to a narrow field of view. That is a
normal lens camera, not an orthographic one, so scale is not perfectly constant across
the arena floor and a small amount of outward lean remains toward the edges of the
screen. Narrowing the field of view reduces both, which is why it is narrow. Everything
else Section 1.1 asks for is unchanged: the camera is locked, it is top-down, it is
anchored at a fixed height, and it holds the whole arena in view.

**Why.** UEFN's only true orthographic camera is a Scene Graph camera component, and
Epic's documentation states of that feature: "You cannot publish a project that uses
Scene Graph camera components at this time." A capstone that has to be published cannot
use it. See [Cameras in Unreal Editor for
Fortnite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/cameras-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

Of the camera devices that can be published, the Fixed Angle Camera is the one Epic
describes as able to "move to follow the player, but doesn't rotate," and calls "great
for top down games, side scrollers, and more." It exposes a field of view setting and has
no orthographic mode. See [Using Fixed Angle Camera Devices in Fortnite
Creative](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-fixed-angle-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
