# GDD Amendment 8, excerpt: hostile movement speed scaling

**This is an excerpt, not a new document.** It is lines 334 to 424 of
`GDD_AMENDMENTS.md`, copied verbatim from the root of the *Sponsor Me, Slayers!*
project. That log holds nineteen amendments covering the whole game. Only this
one is reproduced here, because it is the source for three of the six rules the
pipeline's Evaluator enforces.

**Why it is in this submission.** `evaluator.py` cites this amendment for:

| Rule the Evaluator enforces | Where it is stated below |
|---|---|
| Sprint speed stays below the player's run speed | "MEASURE THE PLAYER'S RUN SPEED BEFORE BUILDING T3, T4 OR T5" |
| Speed scales at 2.1% per tier, compounded | "The rate: 2.1% per tier" |
| Run is 87.5% of sprint, walk is 62.5% | "The rate: 2.1% per tier" |

The Evaluator's other three rules come from the GDD itself: difficulty rising by
8% per tier and the Tier 21 hard cap from Section 5.5, and the 40-hostile
concurrency cap from Section 5.3.

**Status of the amendment:** a clarification of GDD Section 5.5, ruled on by the
designer on 2026-08-16. The player's run speed it names has still not been
measured, which is the limitation the pipeline's ReadMe states up front.

## 8. Hostile movement speed scaling -- A CLARIFICATION OF 5.5, NOT A DEPARTURE

**What the GDD says.** Section 5.5: "Completing a room cleared wave escalates difficulty
by exactly 8% per tier. Hostile maximum health pools, movement speeds, and spawn
densities scale up incrementally." Section 2.2 names "circular 'kiting' and evasion
techniques" as what the control scheme exists to enable. Section 5.7 lists twin-stick
aiming among the features that "remain strictly uncuttable."

**The decision, made by Kailee on 2026-08-16.** Hostile movement speed scales every tier,
as 5.5 requires. It scales at a gentler rate than 8%, chosen so it never exceeds the
player's speed. Health pools and spawn densities stay at the full 8% per tier, untouched.

**Why a literal 8% cannot be what 5.5 means.** Compounded over twenty tiers, 8% per tier
takes a 4.0 m/s Cyber-Swarmer to roughly 19 m/s at Tier 21, over three times the player's
speed. Two things elsewhere in the GDD break at that point, and neither is optional:

  * **Kiting becomes physically impossible.** A player cannot circle an enemy that closes
    faster than they can retreat. GDD 2.2's stated purpose for the entire twin-stick
    scheme stops functioning, and 5.7 forbids cutting it.

  * **The Career Sponsor Rank ladder in 2.6 flattens.** When hostiles outrun everybody,
    every run ends at the same tier regardless of skill. The highest-tier-reached record
    stops moving, and one of the two thresholds that advance the rank is dead. 2.6
    depends on runs ending at different tiers for different players.

Read as a difficulty target rather than a literal speed multiplier, 5.5 is fully
satisfied: health and density carry the full 8% while speed climbs gently underneath.
That is the reading adopted here, which is why this is a clarification and not a cut.

**Precedent.** Horde survivor games escalate through health and density, not by making
ordinary enemies outrun the player. Where a run needs a hard ending, the genre reaches
for a single dedicated finisher rather than a fleet-footed rank and file.

**The rate: 2.1% per tier**, applied to the sprint value, with run held at 87.5% of
sprint and walk at 62.5%, the ratios the T1 card already used.

| Card | Tiers | walk / run / sprint | Exact sprint | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CyberSwarmerMelee` | 1-4 | 2.5 / 3.5 / 4.0 | 4.000 | Safe. Build now |
| `CyberSwarmerMelee_T2` | 5-8 | 2.7 / 3.8 / 4.3 | 4.347 | Safe. Build now |
| `CyberSwarmerMelee_T3` | 9-12 | 3.0 / 4.1 / 4.7 | 4.724 | **PROVISIONAL** |
| `CyberSwarmerMelee_T4` | 13-16 | 3.2 / 4.5 / 5.1 | 5.133 | **PROVISIONAL** |
| `CyberSwarmerMelee_T5` | 17-21 | 3.5 / 4.9 / 5.6 | 5.578 | **PROVISIONAL** |

Health is unchanged at 40 / 54 / 74 / 101 / 137, which is the full 8% per tier compounded
across blocks of four. Spawn density is unchanged and still scales in `WaveManager.verse`.

### MEASURE THE PLAYER'S RUN SPEED BEFORE BUILDING T3, T4 OR T5

**T3 to T5 are provisional and must not be built until the player's actual run speed has
been measured.** They rest on an estimate, and if the estimate is wrong they cause the
exact failure this amendment exists to prevent.

The whole table assumes the player runs at **6.0 m/s**, from an assumed Fortnite base of
about 5.0 m/s times the Movement Speed Multiplier of 1.2 on the Third Person Controls
device. **The 5.0 base has never been measured.** If the real figure is nearer 5.0 than
6.0, then T4 at 5.1 and T5 at 5.6 both outrun the player outright and T3 at 4.7 is
marginal. T1 at 4.0 and T2 at 4.3 stay safely under either figure, so nothing is blocked
today.

**How to measure it.** `fort_character.GetLinearVelocity()` (Fortnite digest 8440)
returns the character's velocity and its own comment gives the units as **metres per
second**, the same units the character cards use. So the two are directly comparable with
no conversion. Print its length once a second while running in a straight line at full
speed, the same shape as `AimRotationProbe.verse`, and read the number off the log.

Once measured, rebuild the table from the real figure and drop the PROVISIONAL marks.

### The rest of the reasoning

**SPEED STEPS EVERY FOUR TIERS, NOT EVERY TIER, AND THAT IS AN ENGINE LIMIT.** Movement
speed lives on the npc_character_definition and cannot be set at runtime, which
`WaveManager.verse` already records. With five cards and MaxTier 21 the wave manager
splits the range into blocks of four, so the ladder above is a five-step staircase
approximating a smooth 2.1% curve. The rate is per tier; the delivery is per block.

**The player has no sprint at all.** Sprinting is switched off in Island Settings,
Player > Locomotion, because sprinting lowers the weapon and GDD 2.2 requires continuous
fire while moving. So the ceiling the hostiles must stay under is the player's ordinary
run speed, not a sprint.

**Why the curve is not extended to Tier 21 itself.** At 2.1% per tier the continuous
curve reaches 6.061 m/s at Tier 21, which would just pass the player. It never arrives,
because the fifth card takes effect at Tier 17 and holds through Tier 21, capping the
speed actually encountered at 5.578. The staircase is what keeps the promise; the curve
alone would break it in the last four tiers.

**The chase test, which settles all of this.** Let one Swarmer chase you and run in a
straight line. The gap must open slowly at Tier 1 and still open, barely, at Tier 21. If
a Tier 21 Swarmer closes on you, lower the top card. Do not raise the player.
